🎯 Number Guessing Game in C
A simple and fun command-line game written in C where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number. Great for beginners learning loops, conditionals, and basic logic building in C.

🧠 How It Works
The computer randomly generates a number within a specific range (e.g., 1–100).

The user is prompted to guess the number.

After each guess, the program gives a hint:

📈 "Higher!" if the guess is too low.

📉 "Lower!" if the guess is too high.

The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.

The total number of attempts is displayed at the end.
